# Game Development 

These projects are done by me for a course in coursera.
Specialization name: Game Design and Development Specialization
Course name: [Introduction to Game Development] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development)

I have provided only WebGL builds of the projects. 
Anyone can run these projects and get inspirations on what to build in the course assignment.

In Firefox or any other browser anyone can load WebGL content locally from there local storage.
### By default, most of the browsers will NOT allow you to load and view local WebGL content due to its security settings.

You can change settings in Firefox to run WebGL content locally. Here's how:
1. Go to about:config address
2. then search for privacy.file_unique_origin
3. set its value as False.

Now you can run the WebGL content locally.

To run WebGL, opne index.html of that particular project.
